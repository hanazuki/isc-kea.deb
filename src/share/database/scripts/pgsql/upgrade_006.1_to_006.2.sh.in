-- Starting from this version we allow specifying multiple IP reservations
-- for the same address in certain DHCP configurations. The server may check
-- uniqueness of the IP addresses on its own. This is no longer checked at
-- the database level to facilitate the use cases when a single host may
-- get the same reserved IP address via different interfaces.

-- Replace the unique index with non-unique index so the queries for
-- hosts by IPv4 address are still efficient.
--
-- Note we have introduced a bug a while ago which causes the index to have
-- different names depending on whether the schema was created via the
-- dhcpdb_create.pgsql script or via updates. Therefore, let's make sure
-- that we drop the index regardless of its current name.
