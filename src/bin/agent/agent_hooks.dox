@page agentHooks The Hooks API for the Control Agent

@section agentHooksIntroduction Introduction
The Kea Control Agent features "Hooks" API that allows the user-written
code to be integrated with the Control Agent and handle some
of the control commands. The hooks library can be either used to provide
support for the new commands (not supported natively by the Control Agent)
or "override" implementation of the existing handlers. The hooks library
signals to the Control Agent that it has processed the given command by
setting "next step status" value to SKIP.

The hooks library can also be used to perform some additional tasks
related to reception of the control command instead of handling it, e.g.
logging or notifying some external service about reception of the
command.

 @subsection agentHooksAuth auth

 - @b Arguments:
   - name: @b request, type: isc::http::HttpRequestPtr, direction: <b>in/out</b>
   - name: @b response, type: isc::http::HttpResponseJsonPtr, direction: <b>in/out</b>

 - @b Description: this callout is executed when Control Agent receives a
   control command over the RESTful interface (HTTP).
   The "request" argument is a pointer to the request, in fact a
   PostHttpRequestJsonPtr. The "response" argument is the response in
   case of errors. The purpose of this callout is to implement authentication
   and authorization. It is called after basic HTTP authentication.
   The next step status is ignored: if the response is set the processing
   will stop and the response is returned. In particular the command is not
   forwarded.

 @subsection agentHooksResponse response

 - @b Arguments:
   - name: @b request, type: isc::http::HttpRequestPtr, direction: <b>in</b>
   - name: @b response, type: isc::http::HttpResponseJsonPtr, direction: <b>in/out</b>

 - @b Description: this callout is executed when Control Agent executed
   a control command over the RESTful interface (HTTP).
   The "request" argument is a pointer to the request. It is used as a
   reference and for callout contexts. The "response" argument is the
   response which will be sent back to the requesting client.  It is
   called after command processing.  The next step status is ignored:
   the response possibly modified will be sent back.
