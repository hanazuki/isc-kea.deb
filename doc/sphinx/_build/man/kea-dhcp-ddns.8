Kea comes with an extensive Kea Administrator Reference Manual that covers
all aspects of running the Kea software \- compilation, installation,
configuration, configuration examples, and much more. Kea also features a
Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible messages Kea can print
with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are
available in various formats (.txt, .html, .pdf) with the Kea
distribution. The Kea documentation is available at
\fI\%https://kea.readthedocs.io\fP\&.
.sp
Kea source code is documented in the Kea Developer\(aqs Guide. Its online
version is available at \fI\%https://reports.kea.isc.org/dev_guide/\fP\&.
.sp
The Kea project website is available at \fI\%https://kea.isc.org\fP\&.
.SH MAILING LISTS AND SUPPORT
