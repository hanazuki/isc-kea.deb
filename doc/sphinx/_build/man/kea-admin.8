.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBkea\-admin\fP is a shell script that offers database maintenance. In
particular, it features database initialization, database version
checking, and database schema upgrading.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBcommand\fP
Specifies the command to be issued to the servers. It can be one of the
following:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBdb\-init\fP
Initializes a new database schema. This is useful during a new Kea
installation. The database is initialized to the latest version
supported by the version of the software being installed.
.TP
.B \fBdb\-version\fP
Reports the database backend version number. This is not necessarily
equal to the Kea version number, as each backend has its own
versioning scheme.
.TP
.B \fBdb\-upgrade\fP
Conducts a database schema upgrade. This is useful when upgrading Kea.
.TP
.B \fBlease\-dump\fP
Dumps the contents of the lease database (for MySQL or
PostgreSQL backends) to a CSV (comma\-separated values) text file. (Support
for the Cassandra backend has been deprecated.)
The first line of the file contains the column names. This can be used
as a way to switch from a database backend to a memfile backend.
Alternatively, it can be used as a diagnostic tool, so it provides a
portable form of the lease data.
.TP
.B \fBlease\-upload\fP
Uploads leases from a CSV (comma\-separated values) text file to a MySQL or
a PostgreSQL lease database. The CSV file needs to be in memfile format.
.TP
.B \fBstats\-recount\fP
Recounts lease statistics for a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBbackend\fP
Specifies the backend type. Currently allowed backends are: memfile,
mysql, and pgsql; cql has been deprecated.
.TP
.B \fB\-h|\-\-host hostname\fP
Specifies the hostname when connecting to a database.
The default value is \fBlocalhost\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-P|\-\-port port\fP
Specifies the port when connecting to a database. If not specified,
the default value chosen by the database client is used.
.TP
.B \fB\-u|\-\-user username\fP
Specifies the username when connecting to a database.
The default value is \fBkeatest\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-p|\-\-password password\fP
Specifies the password when connecting to a database.
If only \fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-password\fP is given, the user is prompted for a password.
If not specified at all, the \fBKEA_ADMIN_DB_PASSWORD\fP environment variable
is checked for a value and used if it exists.
Otherwise the default value of \fBkeatest\fP is used.
.TP
.B \fB\-n|\-\-name database\-name\fP
Specifies the name of the database to connect to. The
default value is \fBkeatest\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-d|\-\-directory script\-directory\fP
Specifies the override scripts directory. That script is used during
upgrades, database initialization, and possibly other operations.
The default value is \fB(prefix)/share/kea/scripts/\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-o|\-\-output output_file\fP
Specifies the file to which the lease data will be dumped. Required for
\fBlease\-dump\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-v|\-\-version\fP
Prints the \fBkea\-admin\fP version and quits.
.TP
.B \fB\-4\fP
Directs \fBkea\-admin\fP to lease\-dump the DHCPv4 leases. Incompatible with
the \-6 option.
.TP
.B \fB\-6\fP
Directs \fBkea\-admin\fP to lease\-dump the DHCPv6 leases. Incompatible with
the \-4 option.
.TP
.B \fB\-x|\-\-extra\fP
Specifies an extra argument to pass to the database command tool e.g.
to invoke \fBmysql\fP with the \fB\-\-ssl\fP argument. This can be repeated
to pass more than one argument. Quotes are not preserved. Avoid commands
containing spaces.
.TP
.B \fB\-y|\-\-yes\fP
Assume yes on overwriting temporary files.

Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible messages Kea can print
with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are
available in various formats (.txt, .html, .pdf) with the Kea
distribution. The Kea documentation is available at
\fI\%https://kea.readthedocs.io\fP\&.
.sp
Kea source code is documented in the Kea Developer\(aqs Guide,
