.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBkea\-admin\fP [command] [backend] [\fB\-u\fP database username] [\fB\-p\fP database password] [\fB\-n\fP database name] [\fB\-d\fP scripts directory] [\fB\-4\fP | \fB\-6\fP] [\fB\-o\fP output file] [\fB\-v\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBkea\-admin\fP is a shell script which offers database maintenance. In
particular, it features database initialization, database version
checking, and database schema upgrade.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBcommand\fP
Specifies the command to be issued to the servers. It can be one of the following:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
\fBdb\-init\fP
Initializes a new database schema. This is useful during a new Kea
installation. The database is initialized to the latest version
supported by the version of the software being installed.
.TP
\fBdb\-version\fP
Reports the database backend version number. This is not necessarily
equal to the Kea version number as each backend has its own
versioning scheme.
.TP
\fBdb\-upgrade\fP
Conducts a database schema upgrade. This is useful when upgrading Kea.
.TP
\fBdb\-dump\fP
Dumps the contents of the lease database (for MySQL, PostgreSQL,
or CQL backends) to a CSV (comma\-separated values) text file.
The first line of the file contains the column names. This is meant
to be used as a diagnostic tool, so it provides a portable,
human\-readable form of the lease data.

Specifies the backend type. Currently allowed backends are: memfile,
mysql, and pgsql.

not specified, the default value of \fB(prefix)/share/kea/scripts/\fP is
used.

Specifies the file to which the lease data will be dumped. Required for lease\-dump.
