.SH DOCUMENTATION
.sp
Kea comes with an extensive Kea Administrator Reference Manual that covers
all aspects of running the Kea software \- compilation, installation,
configuration, configuration examples, and much more. Kea also features a
Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible messages Kea can print
with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are
available in various formats (.txt, .html, .pdf) with the Kea
distribution. The Kea documentation is available at
\fI\%https://kea.readthedocs.io\fP\&.
.sp
Kea source code is documented in the Kea Developer\(aqs Guide,
available at \fI\%https://reports.kea.isc.org/dev_guide/\fP\&.
.sp
The Kea project website is available at \fI\%https://kea.isc.org\fP\&.
.SH MAILING LISTS AND SUPPORT
.sp
There are two public mailing lists available for the Kea project. \fBkea\-users\fP
(kea\-users at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea users, while \fBkea\-dev\fP
(kea\-dev at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea developers, prospective
contributors, and other advanced users. Both lists are available at
\fI\%https://lists.isc.org\fP\&. The community provides best\-effort support
on both of those lists.
.sp
ISC provides professional support for Kea services. See
\fI\%https://www.isc.org/kea/\fP for details.
.SH HISTORY
.sp
The \fBb10\-dhcp6\fP daemon was first coded in June 2011 by Tomek
Mrugalski.
.sp
In mid\-2014, Kea was decoupled from the BIND 10 framework and became a
standalone DHCP server. The DHCPv6 server binary was renamed to
\fBkea\-dhcp6\fP\&. Kea 1.0.0 was released in December 2015.
