.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBkeactrl\fP [\fBcommand\fP] [\fB\-c\fP keactrl\-config\-file] [\fB\-s\fP server[,server,...]] [\fB\-v\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBkeactrl\fP is a shell script which controls the startup, shutdown, and
reconfiguration of the Kea servers (\fBkea\-dhcp4\fP, \fBkea\-dhcp6\fP,
\fBkea\-dhcp\-ddns\fP, \fBkea\-ctrl\-agent\fP, and \fBkea\-netconf\fP). It also
provides the means for checking the current status of the servers and
determining the configuration files in use.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
.sp
Depending on the user\(aqs requirements, not all of the available servers need be run.
The \fBkeactrl\fP configuration file specifies which servers are enabled and which
are disabled. By default the configuration file is
\fB[kea\-install\-dir]/etc/kea/keactrl.conf\fP\&.

See the Kea Administrator Reference Manual for documentation of the
parameters in the \fBkeactrl\fP configuration file.

available in various formats (.txt, .html, .pdf) with the Kea
distribution. The Kea documentation is available at
