.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBkea\-shell\fP provides a REST client for the Kea Control Agent (CA).
It takes command as a command\-line parameter that is being sent to CA
with proper JSON encapsulation. Optional arguments may be specified on
the standard input. The request is sent via HTTP and a response is
retrieved, displayed on the standard output.
