.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBkea\-shell\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-v\fP] [\fB\-\-host\fP] [\fB\-\-port\fP] [\fB\-\-path\fP] [\fB\-\-ca\fP] [\fB\-\-cert\fP] [\fB\-\-key\fP] [\fB\-\-auth\-user\fP] [\fB\-\-auth\-password\fP] [\fB\-\-timeout\fP] [\fB\-\-service\fP] [command]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBkea\-shell\fP provides a REST client for the Kea Control Agent (CA).
It takes commands as a command\-line parameter that is sent to the CA
with proper JSON encapsulation. Optional arguments may be specified on
the standard input. The request is sent via HTTP and a response is
retrieved, displayed on the standard output. Basic HTTP authentication
and HTTPS, i.e. TLS transport, are supported.
.SH ARGUMENTS
