# ISC Kea for Debian

## Logging

Following what upstream does with their .deb packaging, the Debian packages by
default log to the systemd journal. If logging to file is desired just edit the
config files and change the loggers "output" to a file under /var/log/kea/,
e.g. for /etc/kea/kea-dhcp4.conf:

  "output": "/var/log/kea/kea-dhcp4.log"

The systemd units automatically create the /var/log/kea/ right ownership and
permissions.
